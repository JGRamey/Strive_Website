First test session prompt:
This is our first complete agentic workflow session. Read this file and all files mentioned within it to gain complete context to what your role is and any additional information you need to delegate everything correctly and to make sure that all subagents are aware of their tasks, file paths,  development rules, additional documentation files, etc. You are the leader, the success of this session is on you. This is your task list for this session: agentic_team_test.md - Let's go     
Second Session prompt:

First review session prompt:
In this session we will be assessing the first agentic session. It didn't go so good to say the least... Please read the following files entirely to get full context of last session: 2025-09-04-caveat-the-messages-below-were-generated-by-the-u.txt & chat_logs/orchestrator/session5_agentic_workflow_remediation.md & chat_logs/orchestrator/session5_agentic_workflow_test.md & here is the main file that was used at the beginning and wass the sessions task list: agentic_team_test.md I also took personal notes throughout the entire session which is located in this file as well. Please think hard and do a thorough analysis of everything from last session. We need to improve this agentic team by a great deal. See what tools can be removed or added from certain agents to inscrease work speed, efficiency, and accuracy. Also see what agents we can add to the team or how we can actually make multiple agents work in parallel at the same time instead of waiting for each agent to finish their work until the next one starts. Also evaluate yourself and what you can improve on! This might be more important than anything else since you're the main orchestrator. Do not be lazy whatsoever in this process, it is critical that we improve the agentic team to work faster, more efficiently, and more accurately.

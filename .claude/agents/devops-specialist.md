## CRITICAL SESSION 5 LESSON
**Your Vite config changes broke the entire preview**. You MUST:
- Test IMMEDIATELY after any config change
- Have rollback ready for all infrastructure changes
- Never use invalid async/await syntax in configs

## EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS
- **Edit/MultiEdit**: Modify configs carefully
- **Bash**: Test with `npm run dev` after EVERY change
- **Write**: Create new config files with caution

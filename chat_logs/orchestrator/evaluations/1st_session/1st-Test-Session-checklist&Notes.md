Fix nav bar for all pages (should be translucent/transparent in the hero section but then carry the hero section gradient color as soon as the nav bar hits the end of the hero section) - This code was edited last session but it actually broke the nav bar to where it flickers when scrolling.

- Home Page - 

First session task: Analyze the home page and see if icon usage is high. I personally think it is but I'm not an expert. If so, what could we do differently? --- This was updated in the first agentic team session but I want to rollback to what we had on the home page in the last session for the "Integrated Business Platform" section.



1. The demo preview video section is still too small on big displays (I think it might look alright for smaller display screens/devices) even after we updated it in the last session, please make sure that it is. Also, the buttons for the arrows on the sides of the demo preview section are not formatted correctly either for bigger displays, we need to fix this. Additionally, I want to only have the side arrows on the left and right of the demo presentation section. I don't want anything around them like the boxes that are currently there. 

2. Please change the "Watch Demos" to "View Demos" in the hero section of the home page which takes them to the demo filtered section in the portfolio. - Completed in last session, looks good.

3. The "Connect With Us" section at the bottom was updated in the last session but now it's too much. Just rollback to what was there before. 

5.  After rolling back the "CONNECT WITH US" section at the bottom of the page, please make sure we change out the title of the cards/badges in this section to be more focused on company centered aspects of what it's like to work with us and what it's like to become a partner with strive. 

6. Add discord icon to the footer on all pages which links to Strive's discord: https://discord.gg/q3djnrvP29 - This was implemented in the last session and it looks amazing.

7. “Integrated Business Platform” section needs to be updated or changed. We could cater it to our app/website which gives customers the ability to be in the loop on their project status and oversight with daily snapshots on overall progress and visuals if applicable. - This was updated in the last session but I want to roll it back to what we had before. - After doing this, please use the existing modal (pop out system) that's used on all other pages on this sections cards/badges.

8. Make “Why Choose Strive” the main text so it pops out rather than being a secondary text - Keep this part of this section the same even after this section is rolled back to it's previous state.

9. Change “View Success Stories” in Why Choose Strive to - Meet the Team - Completed in last session and is good to go - Just add a orange button outline and we're good to go. Make sure it matches the "View Demos" button at the top of the page

10. The orange "Strive" logo/text in the footer and the nav bar section of the website needs to be changed to this logo (make sure that the appearance looks right formatting wise when you put this logo in):  ![alt text](STRIVE_orange_text_transparent_1500x1500.png)

-Solutions Page-

- Need to change the “By Industry” and “Solution Type” badges/cards to be more specific to the actual Industry (Healthcare, Tech, Logistics, Law, etc.) and the specific Solution Type (Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Predictive Model, etc.) - This was attempted in last session but still needs to be done. I'm talking about the small text section underneath each cards/badges main title where it literally says either "By Industry" or "Solution Type" - This should be changed to actually be accurate to what type of industry or what type of solution the card/badge is talking about. 


- Portfolio Page -

Change text in the header to say something that fits the page. It’s a portfolio page. So maybe use “Strive presents…” Or just use the word presents or another word that would look and sound better since this is the text hook for the patch. We need to use the gradient design on keywords in this text header like we did on the Home and Portfolio Page - This was done in last session and I like it for the most part but we need to only have gradient words in the main text header instead of both the main and sub header sections. 

- Fix the badge/card title text color on all badges to be orange instead of white. It currently blends in with the badge/card color - This was done nicely in the last session, good job. Now all that we need to do is change the project type text color to dark blue (#020a1c) and to make sure that all card/badges match in formatting because currently, some of the cards/badges have their "View Details" button lower than others. Let's use the "Computer Vision Analytics" card/badge as the reference and make all other cards formatting and dimensions match that one. Please make sure not to change any of the content within the cards/badge, we are just changing the overall size of the badges to match along with the structuring and layout. 

- Resources Page - 

1. Remove "Knowledge Center" from the hero section and add the bookcase lucid icon in it’s place. It should match what the brain-circuit icon in size (on portfolio page)

2.

(Completed and implemented on Consultation Page, make sure it works)Additionally, we need to have the Calendly window on a page for people to schedule meetings with us instead of going through the entire process of filling out information.
OR, we could ask the user when they would like to meet in the Contact Us form which will automatically schedule them on the Calendly app -> they should receive a confirmation email with the meeting time and date and form of communication (Google Meet, Discord, Phone Call, Microsoft Teams?, etc.)

- Contact Page - 

Change the background of this page to be the gradient design that’s used in all of the hero sections. Make the badges/cards an off white color (#ffffffeb) and the text box color to dark blue (#020a1c). Use the orange color as the text box outline. Make sure that the text color used on all badges/cards don’t blend in with the badge/card color. Make it visually appealing.
In the Quick actions badge/card change the “Live Chat Support” link to open up a window with our ChatBot “Sai” - I will put this ChatBot file into the directory later today. For now just make the page and chat layout with Sai for filler content. Make this new chat page visually appealing as well.
Update the Schedule Consultation page to get more information from the user in regard to their business and what their business does.
Need to fix “Schedule a Demo” button, it doesn’t go to any page. Make it go to the “Get started page” - Unless we want a different page specifically for demo requests so that way we know what the user is reaching out about (will provide more organization)
Change Business Hours to EST

-About Us Page-
Change to “Company”
Create nav bar dropdown to list “Become a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

- Login Page - 

Add forgot password selection
Make the “Welcome to Strive” badge/card the same color and design of the websites hero section using the same gradient look.

- Get Started Pages - 

- Step 3 of 3 page: please make this card/badge color the same off white color that we use for every other area of white in the project (#ffffffeb) - After doing this, please make sure that this color of white is being used for any white backgorunds that are used. BACKGROUNDS SPECIFICALLY, NOT ANYTHING ELSE.

- Step 3 of 3 page: make the "Last Step" text color the same as the gradient color that's used on all hero sections throughout the website. Additionally, change the button color to this gradient as well.




# SESSION ANALYSIS & RESULTS #
- I can see that we need "research" agents (give internet browser MCP and Playwright? think of others and do research or ask claude for advice) that help each architect retrieve context7 library information because it's filling up their context window quickly. - Every single agent is using up a lot of their context window by searching and fetching from Context7 MCP, maybe we have multiple research agents that are spun up at the beginning of the agentic team workflow? Then after they grab all essential documentation that's needed for the session, they could store all of it in a markdown file and organize it to where each architect agent doesn't have to fetch everyting at once... Instead the "library" files that the research agents are creating are laid out in a way that aligns with their tasks for the session and when they will need specific things that are retrieved from context7... I don't know exactly, but I think it might be a step in the right directon possibly.

- The Frontend architect is working solo on all frontend tasks at the moment. Maybe create multiple of these? Or get Claude to have the UI/UX agent work in parallel and simultaneously

- Frontend architect reached 27+ tool uses fairly quickly

- Need to implement a logging system to see exact actions being taken by each agent and by Claude (main orchestrator) to help improve them and to see what tools aren't necessary

- Documentation agent isn't working in parallel with agents - It seems the same is true for the main orchestrator (claude)

- Essential to have claude make an entire markdown file about this entire session to see why certain things were done and what exactly was happening for each agent during their workflows - Also have claude make recommendations on what to change or edit about each individual agent or what to change about the workflow in order to make it better overall

- Can't see the preview of the website any longer in the preview tab of Replit at this point

- There is now 886 lines of code in the client/pages/home file - Have claude explain this and to see why - It goes against the development rules but maybe there's good reason behind it and might have been necessary

- Seems as if the subagents are also using the Serena MCP server which might be a bad thing or could be a good thing... It's probably slowing down their pace but if it helps them be more accurate then I don't mind. In order to make this better though, we could have the main orchestrator (claude) go through each task at the beginning of the session during the planning phase and specifically layout the paths of files and folders that the agents will be working with/in. If they need help finding something then they should ask claude (main orchestrator) - Or maybe we should create another subagent for this type of task/role?

- Look at session chat log that was printed here: 2025-09-04-caveat-the-messages-below-were-generated-by-the-u.txt2025-09-04-caveat-the-messages-below-were-generated-by-the-u.txt

- Session ended up not going too bad after Claude saved the day by fixing all of the agents mistakes...
- A lot to improve on with the agents and overall agent team - Same goes for the workflow

- Need to go back and analyze everything that was actually implemented and changed on the website - Make sure to update the task list at the top of this file to see what needs to be done and also what was "fixed" but not actually fixed - PRIME EXAMPLE: THE NAV BAR IS WORSE NOW THAN WHAT IT WAS BEFORE 


Claude plan: (Cant copy and paste from the Replit shell so I need to export the chat)

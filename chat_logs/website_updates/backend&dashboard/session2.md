```

### 2. Existing Authentication Infrastructure
**Understand what's already built:**

```bash
# Current authentication wrapper (MUST UNDERSTAND)
/home/runner/workspace/client/src/lib/auth.tsx
# This wraps Supabase auth to maintain backward compatibility

# Supabase authentication implementation
/home/runner/workspace/client/src/lib/supabase-auth.tsx
# Lines 15-341: useAuth hook implementation
# Lines 343-380: ProtectedRoute component

# Supabase client configuration
/home/runner/workspace/client/src/lib/supabase-client.ts
# Contains client setup and helper functions

# Type definitions
/home/runner/workspace/client/src/lib/types/supabase.ts
# Database types and interfaces
```

### 3. Server-Side Infrastructure
**Backend implementation to integrate with:**

```bash
# Supabase routes (currently active when env vars present)
/home/runner/workspace/server/routes-supabase.ts
# Lines 62-285: Current API endpoints
# Focus on auth endpoints (lines 130-180)

# Server configuration with conditional routing
/home/runner/workspace/server/index.ts
# Lines 6-10: Supabase detection logic
# Lines 52-66: Dynamic route loading

# Permission system
/home/runner/workspace/server/utils/permissions.ts
# Complete permission matrix already defined
# Role hierarchy: master_admin > admin > employee > client

# Admin utilities
/home/runner/workspace/server/utils/supabase-admin.ts
# User management functions
```

### 4. Dashboard System
**Role-based dashboards already created:**

```bash
# Dashboard router (implements role-based routing)
/home/runner/workspace/client/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx

# Individual dashboards
/home/runner/workspace/client/src/pages/dashboard/client/index.tsx
/home/runner/workspace/client/src/pages/dashboard/admin/index.tsx
/home/runner/workspace/client/src/pages/dashboard/employee/index.tsx
```

### 5. Database Schema
**Already deployed to Supabase:**

```bash
# Database schema (for reference)
/home/runner/workspace/server/migrations/001_supabase_schema.sql
# Focus on users table (lines 13-35)
# Role enum: master_admin, admin, employee, client

# RLS policies
/home/runner/workspace/server/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql
# User access policies (lines 18-50)
```

## 📋 PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT

### Phase 2 Core Requirements (from supabase-prompt.md):

```markdown
Build a four-tier user system with the following hierarchy:
- **Master Admin**: Can assign any role and permission to any user
- **Admin**: Full access to CRM, CMS, analytics, and user management

Fix nav bar for all pages (should carry the hero section gradient color as soon as the nav bar passes the hero section)

- Home Page - 
Analyze the home page and see if icon usage is high. I personally think it is but I'm not an expert. If so, what could we do differently?



1. The demo preview video section is too small now. Please increase the size by 1.25x. Also, the buttons for the arrows on the sides of the demo preview section are not formatted correctly either, we need to fix this. Additionally, I want to remove the circles around the arrows on these two buttons.

2. Please change the "Watch Demos" to "View Demos" in the hero section of the home page which takes them to the demo filtered section in the portfolio.

3. Change the “Get Started” button to 

4. The "Connect With Us" section at the bottom of the page is pretty bland. It shouldn't stand out too much because it's at the bottom of the page and would also take away from the content section which is right above it. Let's make this section just look more visually appealing. 

5.  Change "View Success Stories" button to "Discover Solutions" which then takes the customer to the Solutions page

6. Add discord icon to the footer on all pages which links to Strive's discord: https://discord.gg/q3djnrvP29

7. “Integrated Business Platform” section needs to be updated or changed. We could cater it to our app/website which gives customers the ability to be in the loop on their project status and oversight with daily snapshots on overall progress and visuals if applicable.
8. Make “Why Choose Strive” the main text so it pops out rather than being a secondary text 
9. Change “View Success Stories” in Why Choose Strive to - Meet the Team

4. The orange "Strive" in the footer section of the website needs to be changed to all caps and needs to be in the Mokoto font to match the logo. This needs to be done for the footer section on all pages 

-Solutions Page-

Need to change the “By Industry” and “Solution Type” badges to be more specific to the actual Industry (Healthcare, Tech, Logistics, Law, etc.) and the specific Solution Type (Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Predictive Model, etc.)

- Portfolio Page -

Change text in the header to say something that fits the page. It’s a portfolio page. So maybe use “Strive presents…” Or just use the word presents or another word that would look and sound better since this is the text hook for the patch. We need to use the gradient design on keywords in this text header like we did on the Home and Portfolio Page
Fix the badge/card title text color on all badges to be orange instead of white. It currently blends in with the badge/card color

- Resources Page - 

1. Remove "Knowledge Center" from the hero section and add the bookcase lucid icon in it’s place.

2. Put

(Completed and implemented on Consultation Page, make sure it works)Additionally, we need to have the Calendly window on a page for people to schedule meetings with us instead of going through the entire process of filling out information.
OR, we could ask the user when they would like to meet in the Contact Us form which will automatically schedule them on the Calendly app -> they should receive a confirmation email with the meeting time and date and form of communication (Google Meet, Discord, Phone Call, Microsoft Teams?, etc.)

- Contact Page - 

Change the background of this page to be the gradient design that’s used in all of the hero sections. Make the badges/cards an off white color (#ffffffeb) and the text box color to dark blue (#020a1c). Use the orange color as the text box outline. Make sure that the text color used on all badges/cards don’t blend in with the badge/card color. Make it visually appealing.
In the Quick actions badge/card change the “Live Chat Support” link to open up a window with our ChatBot “Sai” - I will put this ChatBot file into the directory later today. For now just make the page and chat layout with Sai for filler content. Make this new chat page visually appealing as well.
Update the Schedule Consultation page to get more information from the user in regard to their business and what their business does.
Need to fix “Schedule a Demo” button, it doesn’t go to any page. Make it go to the “Get started page” - Unless we want a different page specifically for demo requests so that way we know what the user is reaching out about (will provide more organization)
Change Business Hours to EST

-About Us Page-
Change to “Company”
Create nav bar dropdown to list “Become a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

- Login Page - 

Add forgot password selection
Make the “Welcome to Strive” badge/card the same color and design of the websites hero section using the same gradient look.

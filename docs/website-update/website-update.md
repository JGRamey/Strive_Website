### Entire implementation list for the website ###

- 

# Entire Website # 

- Change all "consultation" buttons to "Schedule Discovery Call"

- Make sure that all "Consultation" wording is removed from the site and the discovery meeting lingo replaces it

# Home Page #

- Still need to configure the demo preview size on all display sizes - It currently looks really small on my computer monitor

# Solutions Page #

- 

# Portfolio Page #

- 

# Resources Page #

- 

# Company Page # - Haven't implemented yet - Needs refinement

- Create nav bar dropdown to list â€œBecome a Partner, Community (discord and more), Meet the Team, etc. - Think of more areas and pages/sections to add to this page or part of the website - We need to decide whether to make this one entire page broken into different sections or to make it different pages (could make it one page with different pop out screens that go into more detail like on other pages)

- (optional) Make each "Visionary" / Employee card have the same pop out functionality that exists on the other pages - This will be a pop out card that gives further detail on each individual 

# Contact Page #



# Consultation Page #

- Change text color of the text above the text boxes to dark blue (#020a1c)

# Login Page #

- Maybe change the gray text on the sign up page?

# Schedule Consultation Page #

- 

# Request Pages # 
### Request Demo / Request Solution Page and 'steps' subpages ###

- Fix the formatting of the "3 Steps" - Make the step bubbles and text align (each bubble should be aligned with the middle of the actual text)

- Change wording on "Request Recieved" page from to be more specific the process and timeline of the showcase


# Mobile Design List #
### Look at the full Mobile Update markdown file in the website-update folder

- Make mobile specific design way more mobile centric - example: "What's New with Strive?" section should have a scroll feature where the different cards can be rotate horizontally

- Make ROI calculator one card where the user can see everything when adjusting the sliding bar

- Remove demo preview dots in home page hero section (only remove them on mobile or smaller displays)

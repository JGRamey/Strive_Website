# List of things to be implemented or improved

Make sure website is using React and Next.js languages

## Home Page ##
- Login button needs to work and go to the login/sign up screen
- Strive logo and text asset needs to be implemented into top left of page
- Demo section needs to be bigger in hero section (vertically bigger)
- Replace "Strive wins #1..." with ROI section with a sliding calculator and a list of different services that will get them different results based on certain industries (allow them to select their industry and then select certain solutions/services or products) - This section and the "Our Customers" section layout can be combined to create this feature
- Have all "learn more" links work to their respected pages inside of solutions page.
- Fix quick links at the bottom of the page to where when someone clicks on them it takes them to the start of that page
- For now, create a generic Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Cookie Policy so the links will work

## Portfolio Page ##
- Underneath the "Live Demos" header, lets create 3 columns/sections that people can go into: AI Models, Custom Software, and Blockchain
- The template section should be used for Web design and other areas of design like UI/UX
  

## Solutions Page ##
- Lets improve this pages design while still staying on theme with all other pages of the website. As of now, it doesn't have much variation or "wow" factor. I want to say, I like the hover affect with the orange shadow that appears in the "Industry-Specific Solutions" section, maybe make the glow slightly more noticeable and add that same affect to the "Our Solutions" section? 
- The Solutions section in the nav bar should have a dropdown feature where users can see specific industry solutions (use motive website navbar dropdown as inspiration)
- Add Threat Detection models to the list under "AI & Automation"
- Change "Cloud Infrastructure" to "BlockChain" solutions
- Change "Security & Compliance" to Smart Business Solutions (Sales/CRM, HR work, etc.)
- Make separate pages for all of the "Industry-Specific Solutions" and make sure you can access them by clicking on their respected containers on the bottom of the Solutions page.
